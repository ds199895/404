# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Architecture Design and Theory at the School of Architecture, Southeast University. My research focuses on generative design, including graphic algorithms and data analysis. I have an outgoing personality, enjoy trying new things, and maintain a curious mindset. Additionally, I excel in team communication and collaboration with strong execution skills. In addition to my research focus, I have also expanded my skill set to include front-end development, secondary development, and ROS drone simulation.
